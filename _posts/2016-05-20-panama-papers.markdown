### The Idea

* Practicing python with the Panama Papers dataset
* Key findings:
  * The top 5 source countries of companies found in the Panama Papers are: British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, Switzerland, "Not Identified" and Panama. I guess the lawyers and accountants have learnt to hide their trail well. Apart from the clear suspects (BVI, Panama), there is a big chunk which is "Not Identified" - and this makes it quite hard to conclusively identify tax havens.
  * Even though Singapore is often touted as a possible tax haven, the figures show that the degree to which it houses companies related to the Panama Papers is much lesser as compared to Hong Kong, Switzerland, British Virgin islands. That said, as a source country, it is ranked 15th (5,867 companies), right after the United States (6,254 companies). As a jurisdiction (destination country), it is ranked 11th (668 companies), right after Nevada (1,260 companies) and Hong Kong (1,331).

### The Stack
* Done on Python (pandas and plotly)

The app that hopes to disrupt Singapore's tuition industry

### The Big Idea

The app hopes to:

- make learning math fun and addictive through gamification
- maximise learning by engaging both the left brain (logic and words) and the right brain (imagination and visuals)
- provide unlimited quests and questions on topics covered by PSLE, 'O' and 'N levels'
- provide immediate feedback on what the user knows/doesn't know
- encourage active learning through guided hints
- reduce teachers' workload (no marking needed!)
